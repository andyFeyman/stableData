# Building Tools for Exploring Reality

This project is focused on creating a set of useful tools to help users explore and interact with the world around them.  While the specific nature of these tools may evolve, the core goal is to provide practical and insightful applications.

**What this application does:**

This application is a collection of tools designed to provide practical solutions for everyday tasks and potentially aid in the exploration of information. Examples of potential tools might include:

*   **Data visualization:**  Tools for displaying data in an understandable way.
*   **Utility tools:** Helpful functions such as calculators, converters, or organizers.
*   **Information Aggregation:** Consolidating information from different sources.
*   **Exploration tools**: Helps you explore things you are interested in.

This is an ongoing development, and the exact tools included will be refined over time. The project's core is to build tools that are useful and well-crafted.

**Prerequisites for Deployment:**

Before deploying this application, you'll need to have the following installed and configured:

1.  **Node.js:** This project relies on Node.js as its runtime environment. Ensure you have Node.js (version 18 or later recommended) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can check this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
2.  **Vite:** This project uses Vite as a build tool. While Vite is typically installed as a project dependency, you should be familiar with its basic usage and configurations.
3. **Material UI:** This project uses Material UI as UI library. Therefore, you should know how to use Material UI.
4.  **Git:** This is essential for cloning the repository and managing changes.
5. **Basic knowlage of web development:** Such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

**Future Development**
This project is a WIP, and will constantly evolve in the future.
